# Command Line Interface (CLI) Commands Summary

## I/O Redirection

### Standard Output (`>`)
- Redirects the output of a command to a file.
- Example: `ls > file.txt` saves the output of `ls` into `file.txt`.

### Append Output (`>>`)
- Appends output to an existing file or creates a new one if it doesn't exist.
- Example: `echo "data" >> file.txt`.

### Standard Input (`<`)
- Redirects input from a file instead of the keyboard.
- Example: `command < inputfile.txt`.

## Pipelines (`|`)
- Passes the output of one command as the input to another command.
- Example: `command1 | command2 | command3`.

## Expansion
- Shell expands special characters before executing commands.

## Backslash (`\`)
- Allows multi-line commands by ignoring line breaks.
- Example:
  ```bash
  echo "This is a \
  long command"

## Permissions

### File Permissions
- Linux assigns permissions to files and directories for the owner, group, and others.

### Changing Permissions (`chmod`)
- Changes the file permissions.
- Example: `chmod 600 file.txt` grants read and write permissions to the owner only.

### Superuser (`sudo`)
- Superuser commands require admin privileges.
- Use `sudo` before a command to execute it with superuser privileges.
- Example: `sudo some_command`

### Text Editors
Linux supports both CLI-based and GUI-based text editors.

- `vim` : advanced text editor
- `nano` : simple text editor

### Shell Script
- A **shell script** is a text file containing a series of commands that the shell can execute. It automates repetitive tasks, saving time by allowing you to run multiple commands in sequence.

#### 1. Create a Shell Script File
- Use a text editor (like `nano`, `vim`, or `gedit`) to create a file for your script.

  Example:

  ```bash
  nano myscript.sh
  #!/bin/bash
  ```

#### 2. Write Commands in the File
- write the commands you want to automate. You can include any valid shell commands such as echo, ls.

  Example:
  
  ```bash
  nano myscript.sh
  #!/bin/bash
  echo "Hello, World!"
  ```

#### 3. Save the File
- enter `^X(Ctrl + x)` : Exit, and
 enter `Y` and name the file.

 ### History (`history`)
 - Displays the history of previous commands.
  - You can also save the history to a text file.
  - Example: `history > history.txt`

### wget
- Downloads files from the Internet to your current directory.
- Example: `wget http://example.com/file.zip`

### curl
- Fetches and uploads data over the Internet.
- Example: `curl -O http://example.com/file.zip`

### grep
- Searches for a string within a file.
- Example: `grep "term" file.txt`

#### Common Options
- `i`: Case-insensitive search.
- `v`: Invert match (exclude lines with the term).
- `n`: Show line numbers.
- `r`: Recursive search in directories.

#### Regular Expressions
- `.*`: Matches any character zero or more times.
- `^`: Matches the start of a line.
- `$`: Matches the end of a line.
- `[abc]`: Matches any character within the brackets.
