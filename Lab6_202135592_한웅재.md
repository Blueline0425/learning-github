## Git commands Summary

### **Why use Git?**

- we have to manage version of files including change of file.
it can help our to **collaborate** with others.



### changes vs. snapshots

#### changes 
- Each version stores only the changed parts of the file.

#### snapshots
- If there are any changes, save the file itself anew.
, **git uses this method.**

### Kinds of version control system.

#### local
- Version database is stored only on your computer. it is used for working alone.

#### centralized
- Managing the database of file versions on the server
-> Not available when central server goes down

#### distributed
- A central server exists, but also stores version databases in each computer database,
It prevents the server from breaking down.
Enables direct user communication

### Three states in git

-  **modified**
: Modification in progress
-  **staged**
: Check and commit
- **committed**
: Create a specific version

### Git Configurations
: If changes occur, git has to record all information about changes. So you have to set options about who you are.

- **system level**
: Affects all users who use these repositors
`file: /etc/gitconfig`
- **global(user) level**
: Affects all repositories of the current user
`file: ~/.config/git/config`
- **local level**
: Impact on current repository
`file: .git/gitconfig`



### git setup

---
`git config --global user.name "WoongJae Han"`

`git config --global user.email your-email@gachon.ac.kr`

`git config --global init.defaultBranch main`

---

`git config --list` : Show only the list of settings

`git config --list --show-origin` : Output a list of settings and the file path for those settings

`git config user.name` : show your name

### How to initialize the repository to the current directory

`git init` : init git_repo.

`git status` : show current git status.
- green text(changes to be commited) : progress in **staged** 
- red text(Untracked files) : git doesn't care about these files.

### adding a new file to be staged
`git add [file_name]`

- if you edit files in staged progress using `nano *.txt`,
you will see `changes not staged for commit.`
it means git understands two files that one is current file and the other is changed file.
to solve this problem, you enter `git add [edited file name]`

`git add .` : add all files in this directory to be staged.

`git rm --cached [file_name]` : unstaging a file

### ignoring several files.

`nano .gitignore` : it helps you to ignore several files. in nano text editor, you can enter files to be unstaged.

example
- `*.txt` : ignore all .txt files.
- `build/` : ignore all files in build directory.
- `doc/*.txt` : ignore all .txt files in doc directory
- `doc/**/*.pdf` :  ignore all .pdf files in all directory(including sub-directory)

### commit

`git commit -m "commit message"`

if you want to see logs, enter `git log`


### change branch name
`git branch -m [current name] [changed name]`

`git branch` : show all branches.
